      "question": "What does the permeability of sand measure? (LO1)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The strength of the sand mould",
        "b": "The ability of gases to pass through the sand",
        "c": "The temperature resistance of sand",
        "d": "The hardness of the sand particles"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Permeability in sand moulding refers to the ease with which gases, steam, and air can escape through the sand during metal pouring and solidification. If permeability is too low, gases may get trapped inside the casting, leading to defects like gas porosity, blowholes, and pinholes. Proper permeability ensures better casting quality and fewer defects.",

      "question": "Why is permeability important in casting? (LO1)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To ensure the molten metal solidifies quickly",
        "b": "To allow gases and water vapour to escape from the mould",
        "c": "To increase the weight of the casting",
        "d": "To improve the chemical composition of the metal"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "During casting, the interaction between molten metal and moist sand generates gases and water vapour. If these gases do not escape properly, they become trapped in the solidified metal, causing surface defects or internal porosity. Proper permeability allows for the smooth escape of gases, reducing the chances of casting rejection and rework.",

      "question": "How does grain size affect permeability? (LO4)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Finer grains increase permeability",
        "b": "Coarser grains increase permeability",
        "c": "Grain size has no effect on permeability",
        "d": "Permeability increases only if grains are angular"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Larger grains create bigger pores in the sand structure, allowing gases to escape more easily, improving permeability. Conversely, finer grains pack tightly, reducing pore size and making it harder for gases to escape. However, coarse grains can lead to surface roughness, so a balance between grain size and surface finish is required.",

        "d": "100 cc"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "According to the American Foundrymen Society (AFS), permeability is tested by passing 2000 cc (cubic centimetres) of air through a standard sand specimen under controlled conditions. This standardized volume ensures accurate and repeatable permeability measurements.",
