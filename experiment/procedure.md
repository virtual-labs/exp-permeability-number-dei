### Procedure
1.	Click to select the specific sand sample.
2.	Click on sand to fill it into the specimen tube and ram thrice using sand rammer.
3.	Now the prepared standard specimen is having a diameter 50.8 mm and height 50.8 mm.
4.	Select the permeability meter.
5.	Click on the 'O-P-D' valve knob to set it at 'D' position. 
6.	Pour the water up to the 'W' mark into the water tank.
7.	Insert air tank into water tank carefully.
8.	Slowly lift the air tank to place it at 0 mark.
9.	Click on the 'O-P-D' valve to set it at ‘O’ position 
10.	Note down the initial reading of the manometer.
11.	Click on the standard specimen to place it along with the tube in the inverted position on the rubber boss.
12.	Click on the 'O-P-D' valve knob to put the valve on ‘P’ position. 
13.	Simultaneously start the stopwatch to note the time required to pass 2000 cc of air through the specimen. 
14.	Read the height of the water column in the manometer tube (i.e. Note down the initial reading of the manometer)
15.	Calculate the permeability number by using the formula given. Also check the permeability number provided on the chart appeared on the screen (according to the manometer reading).
